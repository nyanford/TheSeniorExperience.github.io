    <h1>Roommates Tips</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Setting Boundaries | Establishing your boundaries with roommates is critical to help avoid conflict when possible. When it comes to shared spaces, knowing what is off-limits is crucial. Being sure to communicate that at the very beginning will help ensure that some things should stay untouched</li>
	<li>Communication Importance | Creating a good flow of communication between your roommates is key to healthy relationships between them. Just giving them a heads-up about things they may encounter or should know such as visitors, apartment/ house changes, emergencies, etc. is crucial. No one wants to wake up to a random person in their apartment thinking its an intruder when really it was just an unannounced guest...</li>
	<li>Resolving Conflict | While many attempts to avoid conflict may be made, it will still happen eventually and thats normal. Youre not going to be best friends with all your roommates, but it&#39;s nice to be cordial. So, in the event that conflict does arise, approaching it in a calm, and situated manner is key. What has helped many times has been compromising to find a good fit between what you and the other person want. Worse comes to worst, it may not be resolvable and roommate changes may need to take place but this is extreme and most times, unnecessary</li>
